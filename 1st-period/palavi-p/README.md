# About Me
Hi! I’m Palavi P., a student at Mt.Eden, taking AP Computer Science. Throughout the whole year I learned how to use JS, CSS, and HTML. I also used more concepts to create those projects. 


# About This Project
This portfolio is the culmination of my learning and growth as a developer throughout the year. It showcases not only the technical skills I’ve developed but also the creativity and problem-solving I’ve applied to each project.
